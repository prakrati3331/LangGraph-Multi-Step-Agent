# LangGraph Learning Project

This project contains Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts for learning and experimenting with LangGraph, a library for building stateful, multi-actor applications with LLMs.

## Project Structure

- `*.ipynb`: Jupyter notebooks with various LangGraph examples and tutorials
- `main.py`: Main Python script demonstrating LangGraph functionality
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. Start Jupyter Lab:
   ```bash
   jupyter lab
   ```

## Notebooks

1. `1_simple_graph.ipynb` - Basic LangGraph example
2. `2_graph_with_condition.ipynb` - Conditional graph execution
3. `3_Chatbot.ipynb` - Building a chatbot with LangGraph
4. `4_tool_call.ipynb` - Using tools with LangGraph
5. `5_tool_call_Agent.ipynb` - Agent implementation with tool calling
6. `6_Memory.ipynb` - Memory management in LangGraph
7. `7_langsmith.ipynb` - Integration with LangSmith
8. `8_Human_in_the_loop(HITL).ipynb` - Human-in-the-loop workflows

## Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies
